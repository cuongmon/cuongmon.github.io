  <h2>today I am teaching you guys about my special ability.</h2>
  <h3>My special ability is wasting time.</h3>    
  <p>to use this ability, you need to know how to make the time go by quickly
    the easiest way to waste time is to ask a lot of question and make the teacher have to answer all
    of you questions. There is also many other ways to waste time for example like going to the
    bathroom, or sometimes when the teacher tells you to come back try to act tired and you can waste
    a little bit of time. So the key to waste time is you need to have good acting. Like
    when you go to the bathroom. You need to act like it is an emergency and sit in there for Like
  20 minutes. If you are bored, just prepare a electronic device or something like a book so you can
stay in there for a longer time. You need good acting for wasting time. Because when you laugh then 
the teacher know for sure that you are not tired or it is not a emergency. Normally people use this 
skill to waste time on something that you dont't like like learning, doing homework, doing chores, 
when your mom tells you to read a book. Sometimes I waste time by going on a bike
because it is so boring at home and mom keeps telling me to do the chores3  </p>
